Chapter 10: Delivering Results – How to Keep Clients and Get Referrals

The Real Game Starts After the Close

Closing the deal feels great. But here's the truth: the sale is just the beginning.

If you can't deliver results, you won't keep clients. If you can't keep clients, you won't get referrals. And if you don't get referrals, you'll be stuck grinding for new business forever.

This chapter is about building a delivery system that keeps clients happy, creates measurable wins, and turns every engagement into a referral engine.

Your goal isn't just to get paid - it's to become indispensable.

The Delivery Framework

Here's how to structure your client engagements for maximum impact:

1. Kickoff & Expectations (Week 1)
   - Set the tone early.
   - Align on goals, communication rhythm, and success metrics.
   - Make them feel like they made the right decision.

2. Quick Win (Weeks 2–4)
   - Deliver a visible result fast.
   - This could be a process improvement, a time-saving automation, or a lead recovery play.
   - The goal: build trust before tackling bigger projects.

1. Time: "We don't have time for this right now."
2. Budget: "We don't have the money for this."
3. Knowledge: "We don't understand AI well enough yet."

Everything else is noise. Handle these three, and you'll close deals.

Objection #1: "We Don't Have Time"

Translation: "We're overwhelmed, and I don't see how this helps me right now."

Here's how you crush it:

Script:
"I get it. You're busy. But let me ask: are you busy making money, or are you busy wasting time? Because what we just found is that your team is wasting 780 hours a year on manual tasks. That's $30K gone. You don't have a time problem. You have a strategy problem. And that's exactly what I solve."

Silence. Let it land.

The truth is, nobody has time until you show them they're bleeding money. Then suddenly, they find the time.

Objection #2: "We Don't Have the Budget"

Translation: "I don't believe the ROI yet."

Script:
"I hear you. Let's look at the math together. You told me you lose 5 deals a month from slow follow-up. At $10K per deal, that's $600K a year gone. My advisory is $60K a year. So the real question isn't, 'Can you afford $60K?' The real question is, 'Can you afford to keep losing $600K?' Which sounds worse to you?"

This works because you reframe the budget objection into a cost-of-inaction problem. Nobody wants to look like the idiot who chose to lose ten times more money than they saved.

Objection #3: "We Don't Know Enough About AI"

Translation: "We're scared to make the wrong move."

Script:
"Perfect. That's why you need me. If you already had an AI strategy, you wouldn't be talking to me. My role as your Fractional AI Officer is to be the translator - to cut through the noise and give you a roadmap that actually makes sense. You don't need to know everything. That's my job."

Notice the confidence. You take their fear and flip it into your value proposition.

Advanced Reframes

Now let's stack on a few killer reframes you can use in almost any objection.

- Scarcity Reframe:
  "I respect that. But here's the truth: AI is the biggest land grab since the internet. Every month you wait, your competitors are pulling ahead. Who do you think your customers will choose - the company stuck in 2023 or the one running lean with AI?"

- Future-Pacing Reframe:
  "Imagine 12 months from now. You either made this move today and your competitors are chasing you, or you waited and now you're chasing them. Which scenario do you want to be in?"

- Authority Reframe:
  "I work with companies doing $2M–$10M/year. Every one of them thought they weren't ready. Every one of them now says the only mistake was not starting sooner. This isn't about being ready - it's about being led."

The Power of Silence

Here's a secret most salespeople screw up: they talk too much.

When you deliver your objection-handling script, shut up.

Silence is a weapon. It puts pressure back on the prospect. It makes them process what you just said.

If you ramble, you let them off the hook. If you shut up, you force them to face the truth.

Case Study: The "No Budget" Close

One of our Fractional AI Officers pitched a $5K/month advisory. The prospect said, "We don't have the budget."

He anchored against the gap: "You're losing $400K a year. My fee is $60K a year. Can you afford to keep losing $400K?"

Then he went silent. Waited.

The prospect paused, then said: "When can we start?"

Signed. $60K contract. All because he reframed the objection and let silence do the work.

Run the Play (Lindsey's Way)

Your action items for this chapter:

1. Memorize the Big 3 objections and your responses for each.

2. Practice the reframes (Scarcity, Future-Pacing, Authority) until they feel natural.

3. Role-play objection handling with a partner - have them throw curveballs at you.

4. Train yourself to pause after delivering a response. Count to five in your head if you have to.

5. After every sales call, write down what objections came up and how you handled them. Refine your scripts over time.

Chapter 10 Checklist

- Know the Big 3 objections by heart.
- Have a script ready for each.
- Use reframes to flip fear into urgency.
- Master the power of silence.
- Debrief every call and improve your responses.
