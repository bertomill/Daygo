Chapter 9: Running High-Converting Sales Calls

The Call Is Where the Money Is Made

You can have the best positioning. You can have the cleanest offer. You can have messaging that makes people lean in. But if you can't close on a sales call, none of it matters.

The sales call is where strategy turns into revenue.

This chapter is about mastering that moment - running calls that feel natural, build trust, and convert prospects into $5K–$10K/month retainer clients.

No sleazy tactics. No manipulation. Just structure, confidence, and clarity.

Mindset First

Before we get into the mechanics, let's fix your mindset.

Most people go into sales calls nervous. They feel like they're "asking for something." They treat the call like a performance where they have to prove themselves.

Flip that.

You're not begging for business. You're evaluating whether you can help. You're the expert. You're the one with the solution. They booked the call because they have a problem - your job is to figure out if you're the right fit to solve it.

When you approach calls this way, you stop sounding desperate and start sounding like an executive.

- Show them the three-step process: Assess → Roadmap → Advisory.
- Keep it crystal clear.
- Example: "Step 1: We run a $2,500 AI Growth & Profit Assessment to uncover the money you're leaving on the table. Step 2: We build your roadmap. Step 3: I serve as your Fractional AI Officer to make sure you execute and win."

4. The Close (3 minutes):
   - Anchor against the gap.
   - Example: "You're losing $400K a year right now. My advisory is $5K/month. That's $60K/year to save or add $400K. Do you see how that math works?"
   - Then shut up. Let them respond.

Word-for-Word Script

Here's how a 15-minute close sounds:

Opening:
"Hey, I'll keep this short. Right now, everyone's hyped up on AI tools. But tools don't make you money - offers do. My role is to be your Fractional AI Officer. That means I own your AI strategy, so every decision runs through me and you stop bleeding money."

Discovery Questions:

- "Where are you losing time?"
- "What's the slowest part of your sales process?"
- "What repetitive tasks does your team complain about?"
- "Where are you worried competitors might be ahead of you?"

Monetize the Gap:
"So let's do the math. You said your sales team misses 5 deals a month because of slow follow-up. At $10K per deal, that's $50K/month lost. That's $600K a year. Do you see the gap?"

Roadmap Pitch:
"Here's how we fix it. Step 1: We run a $2,500 AI Growth & Profit Assessment. I'll find every gap and put a dollar amount on it. Step 2: I'll build you a custom roadmap. Step 3: I come on as your Fractional AI Officer to execute and keep you on track. $5K/month, 12-month commitment."

Close:
"Based on what you've told me, this is a no-brainer. You're bleeding $600K/year. My fee is $60K. That's a 10x return without lifting a finger. Want to get started this week?"

Then stop talking. Let them respond.

What If They Say No?

Some will say no. That's fine.

Common objections:

- "I need to think about it."
  → "Totally fair. What specifically do you need to think through? I might be able to clarify right now."

- "It's too expensive."
  → "Compared to what? You're already losing $X/year. My fee is a fraction of that."

- "We're not ready."
  → "That's exactly why we start with the assessment. It tells us where to begin."

If they still say no, move on. Not every prospect is a fit. Protect your time and find someone who's ready.

Run the Play (Lindsey's Way)

Your action items for this chapter:

1. Write out your Call Structure (Opening, Discovery, Gap, Pitch, Close).

2. Practice saying the Monetize the Gap section out loud.

3. Role-play with a friend or record yourself. Listen back for confidence and clarity.

4. Prepare objection responses in advance so you're never caught off guard.

5. After each real call, do a quick review: What worked? What didn't? Improve for next time.

Chapter 9 Checklist

- Master the 4-part structure: Rapport → Discovery → Pitch → Close.
- Use Discovery to let them sell themselves on the problem.
- Always tie your pitch to the dollar gap.
- Handle objections calmly with ROI-based responses.
- Practice until your close sounds effortless.
