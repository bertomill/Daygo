Chapter 5: Picking Your Niche – Who You Serve Determines What You Earn

Why Niche Matters More Than Skill

Here's an uncomfortable truth: being good at AI means nothing if you're talking to the wrong people.

You could be the smartest strategist in the room. You could know every tool, every workflow, every automation trick in the book. But if you're pitching to broke businesses, tire-kickers, or people who "just want to learn," you'll stay broke too.

The niche you choose determines your income ceiling.

Pick the wrong niche and you'll grind forever, chasing $500 projects and ghosting clients. Pick the right niche and $5K, $10K, even $20K/month retainers become normal.

This chapter is about making sure you pick the right one.

The "Serve Everyone" Trap

Most people start by trying to serve everyone.

"I help businesses with AI."

That sounds logical - cast a wide net, catch more fish, right?

Wrong.

When you try to serve everyone, you serve no one. Your message becomes generic. Your offer becomes forgettable. And you end up competing on price with every other "AI consultant" on Upwork.

You want the opposite. You want to be so specific that when someone in your niche hears your pitch, they think, "Holy shit, this person gets me."

That's the power of niche.

What Makes a Good Niche?

Not all niches are created equal. Here's what to look for:

1. Money – They need to be able to afford you. Target businesses doing $1M–$50M/year in revenue. These companies have budget, but aren't so big that decisions take six months.

2. Pain – They need a problem AI can solve. Messy operations, slow sales cycles, bloated teams, outdated processes - these are goldmines.

3. Access – You need a way in. Can you reach these people via LinkedIn, referrals, events, content? If you can't get in front of them, the niche is useless.

4. Volume – There need to be enough of them. A niche of 200 companies isn't a niche - it's a dead end. Aim for thousands of potential clients.

Examples of Good Niches

Let me give you a few solid examples:

- Home service businesses (HVAC, roofing, plumbing) – They're making money, their operations are chaos, and they're not tech-savvy. Perfect.

- Med spas and elective healthcare clinics – High margins, repeat customers, tons of admin waste. Easy wins.

- Law firms (under 50 attorneys) – Drowning in admin, slow follow-up, poor client communication. They'll pay to fix it.

- B2B SaaS companies ($1M–$10M ARR) – Fast-moving, growth-focused, already tech-friendly. They get it.

- Real estate brokerages – Lead follow-up is garbage, marketing is messy, onboarding is slow. Gold.

- E-commerce brands ($2M–$20M revenue) – Paid ads, email, operations - all ripe for AI upgrades.

These are just starting points. The goal is to find a group of businesses where AI can deliver measurable ROI, and where you can access decision-makers.

Niches to Avoid

Just as important as knowing where to go is knowing where not to go.

Avoid:

- Solopreneurs and micro-businesses – They don't have budget. Period.

- Highly regulated industries (unless you specialize) – Healthcare, finance, and legal are great if you know compliance. Otherwise, stay away.

- "Everyone" – If your niche is "small businesses," you have no niche.

- Trend chasers – Crypto bros, NFT flippers, "coaches" with no revenue. They talk big but don't pay.

Be ruthless. Not every business deserves your time.

buy.

Your proof can be:

- Real case studies.
- Testimonials.
- Hard numbers from your assessments.
- Even simple "napkin math" showing the cost of inefficiency.

Example: "Your admin team wastes 15 hours a week on manual data entry. At $40/hour, that's $31K/year. My advisory fee is $5K/month. Do you see how cheap that is compared to the waste?"

That kind of math closes deals.

Putting It Together

When you package your offer, here's what it looks like in a pitch:

- Promise: "We help 20-person companies add $500K in profit without adding staff."

- Process: "We do it through a three-step system: assess, roadmap, and ongoing advisory."

- Proof: "Our last client uncovered $400K in lost opportunities and signed a $7,500/month contract to fix it."

That's clean. That's compelling. That's how you sell.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Selling features instead of outcomes. Don't sell "chatbots," sell "faster response times."

- Overloading the offer. More isn't better. Simplicity wins.

- Undervaluing yourself. If your promise is big, your price should match. Don't sell a $500 outcome for $500. Sell it for $5,000.

Run the Play (Lindsey's Way)

Your action items for this chapter:

1. Write your Promise. Make it outcome-based, not tool-based.

2. Define your Process. Keep it to 3 steps max.

3. Gather your Proof. Even one case study or testimonial is enough to start.

4. Test it. Say it out loud. Does it sound like something a business owner would pay for?

5. Refine it. You'll tweak this over time. The first version won't be perfect - and that's fine.

Chapter 5 Checklist

- Write your one-liner Promise (outcome-based).
- Outline your 3-step Process.
- List your current Proof (or plan to collect it).
- Eliminate any feature-based language from your pitch.
- Price your offer based on outcome value, not hours.
