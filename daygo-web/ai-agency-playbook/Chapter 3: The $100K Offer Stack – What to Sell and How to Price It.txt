Chapter 3: The $100K Offer Stack – What to Sell and How to Price It

Why Most People Fail Before They Even Start

Here's a hard truth: most people who try to sell AI services fail not because they lack skill - but because they have no idea what they're actually selling.

They show up to calls saying things like:

"I can help you with AI."

"I do automation and chatbots."

"I'm an AI consultant."

And then they wonder why no one pulls out their credit card.

The problem isn't the market. The problem is the offer. If your offer is vague, your results will be vague. If your pricing is random, your income will be random.

This chapter is about fixing that - permanently.

We're going to build what I call the $100K Offer Stack: a simple, scalable menu of services that positions you as a premium advisor, creates recurring revenue, and sets you up to hit $100K+ in annual income without needing a huge client base.

Let's get into it.

2. Marketing – Content takes forever to create. Campaigns are generic. Nobody's testing offers fast enough.

3. Operations – Employees do repetitive tasks manually. Admin work eats up time. Decision-making is slow because data isn't analyzed.

4. Customer Experience – Support teams drown in tickets. Clients wait for answers. No personalization, no automation, no AI-driven service.

Every business has one or more of these gaps. Your job is to expose them.

How to Find the Gap

So how do you find these gaps? You run what we call the AI Growth & Profit Assessment (AIGPA).

This is your Trojan Horse. You charge $1,000–$5,000 for it, and it's how you walk in the door, earn authority, and set yourself up for the retainer.

The AIGPA framework is simple:

1. Stakeholder Interview – Sit down with the owner/execs. Ask them:
   - Where are you bleeding time?
   - Where are you missing revenue?
   - What's keeping you up at night?
   - Where are competitors beating you?

2. Process Mapping – Look at how they actually do things. Sales calls, onboarding, customer service, marketing campaigns, finance. Map the flow.

3. Gap Analysis – Spot the friction. "Here's where you lose leads. Here's where you waste hours. Here's where you fail to follow up."

4. Monetize the Gap – Assign a dollar amount. "This process is wasting 50 hours/month at $50/hour = $2,500/month wasted. That's $30K/year gone."

5. Roadmap – Present a plan. "Close these gaps with AI strategy and you unlock $250K in profit over the next year. My advisory fee is $5K/month to make sure you get it."

This is how you sell without selling. You're not pitching tools. You're exposing pain. And people will pay anything to make the pain go away.

Example: Sales Gap

Let's take sales.

You talk to a business owner. They admit their sales team struggles to follow up with leads. Some sit for days before anyone reaches out.

You map it. You show them they're losing 20% of opportunities because of slow follow-up.

Let's put a dollar sign on it. If their average deal is worth $10K and they lose five deals a month because of weak follow-up, that's $50K/month - $600K/year - down the drain.

Now, do you think they'll pay you $5K/month to fix that? Hell yes. Because it's not about $5K/month anymore. It's about saving $600K/year.

That's how you win.

Example: Operations Gap

Another example: operations.

You walk into a 20-person company. Their admin team spends 15 hours a week manually entering data from one system to another.

That's 780 hours a year. At $40/hour, that's $31,200 wasted every year.

And that's just one process.

When you show the owner that one simple change could save them $30K+ a year, suddenly your $2,500/month fee feels cheap.

And remember: you don't have to build the solution. You just point it out, roadmap it, and oversee the fix. That's advisory. That's where the money is.

Clients Pay for the Translation, Not the Tools

Here's something I need you to get through your head: business owners aren't stupid. They know AI is out there. They just don't know how to apply it.

They're overwhelmed by noise. ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Jasper, MidJourney, endless tools - they don't know what matters.

You're not selling tools. You're selling translation.

You're the one saying: "Forget the noise. Here's the two things that actually move the needle in your business. Here's what it's worth. Here's the plan."

That's why they'll pay you.

Avoid the Cookie-Cutter Trap

Now, let me warn you: do not turn this into a cookie-cutter checklist.

Too many people want a "step-by-step" AI stack they can slap on every client. That doesn't work.

Every business is different. Their goals are different. Their processes are different. Their gaps are different.

Yes, your sales process is static (FTA → AIGPA → retainer). That never changes. But your recommendations are dynamic. They adapt to the business in front of you.

That's why you're valuable. You're not a robot spitting out the same advice. You're the strategist tailoring the roadmap to the client.

Monetizing the Gap = Closing the Deal

Here's the secret: once you put a dollar amount on the gap, the deal is basically closed.

Business owners make decisions with their wallets. If you say, "You're wasting time," they shrug. If you say, "You're losing $250K/year," they pay attention.

Your advisory fee becomes irrelevant compared to the savings or profit they unlock.

That's the close. That's how you sell without being "salesy." You just show them the math.

Case Study: The Power of the Gap

One of our clients ran their first AI Growth & Profit Assessment.

They charged $2,000 for it.

They discovered the company was losing roughly $400K/year in missed leads and inefficiencies.

They walked back in and said: "You're bleeding $400K/year. I'll oversee the fix for $5,000/month."

The client signed immediately. Because $60K/year for a Fractional AI Officer is nothing compared to saving $400K.

That's the power of the Profit Gap.
