Chapter 19: The $10M Vision – Owning the Market

When you build a firm that dominates an industry, you create an asset. Something you can sell, partner, or franchise.

That's real wealth. That's how you go from making money to building legacy.

What It Looks Like to Own the Market

When you own the market, here's what happens:

- Clients line up for your services.

- Competitors don't stand a chance - you're already the authority.

- Vendors approach you for partnerships.

- Industry leaders invite you to speak, teach, and certify.

It's not about being everywhere. It's about being the one name that matters in your niche.

Avoiding the Plateau

The danger on the path to $10M is plateauing. Getting comfortable at $1M or $2M.

The way to avoid it: keep asking, "What's next?"

- What's the next vertical?

- What's the next playbook?

- What's the next authority move?

Complacency kills momentum. Vision fuels growth.

The Freedom of the $10M Vision

Here's the most important part: the $10M vision isn't just about money. It's about freedom.

- Freedom to work on strategy, not delivery.

- Freedom to build teams and empower others.

- Freedom to shape industries instead of chasing projects.

- Freedom to walk away knowing you've built something that lasts.

That's the real prize.

Run the Play (Lindsey's Way)

Here's how you step into the $10M vision:

The Path to $10M

Here's how it plays out:

1. Lock Your Niche
Start by dominating one vertical. Law firms, healthcare, manufacturing - doesn't matter. Get case studies, testimonials, and brand authority.

2. Build Your Team
Bring on junior advisors, train them with your playbooks, and scale delivery beyond yourself.

3. Expand Verticals
Once your system is proven, expand into new niches. Clone your model and repeat.

4. Establish Authority
Publish thought leadership, run events, launch podcasts or reports. Make yourself the voice of AI strategy in your market.

5. Create an Ecosystem
This is where it multiplies. Build certifications. Launch group programs. Offer advisory at scale. Partner with vendors and industry associations.

That's how you go from $1M to $10M.

Example: Market Ownership in Action

One advisor started in healthcare. Within 18 months, he was the "AI guy" for regional clinics.

He expanded into law firms and manufacturers. He trained a team of junior advisors under his brand.

Two years in, he wasn't just running advisory. He was hosting industry events, speaking on stages, and partnering with national associations.

His firm now runs at $10M/year - because he didn't stop at advisory. He owned the market.

Think Equity, Not Just Income

Here's another mindset shift: advisory retainers are income. Market ownership is equity.

1. Pick your niche and dominate it.

2. Train a team to deliver your playbooks.

3. Expand into new industries with confidence.

4. Establish authority with content, events, and partnerships.

5. Build an ecosystem that scales beyond you.

6. Keep pushing the vision bigger.

Because here's the truth: AI advisory is not just a side hustle. It's not just a consulting gig. It's the next wave of executive leadership.

And the ones who move now, the ones who plant their flag early, won't just make $1M. They'll own the market.

That's the $10M vision.
