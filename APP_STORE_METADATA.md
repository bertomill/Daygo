DayGo is your simple, focused companion for building better daily habits. Track what matters, reflect on your day, and watch your progress grow.

**DAILY HABITS**
Create and track the habits that matter most to you. Check them off as you complete them throughout the day and watch your daily score climb. Start with a few key habits and build from there.

**DAILY MANTRAS**
Set powerful affirmations and reminders that keep you motivated. Your mantras appear alongside your habits, keeping your mindset aligned with your actions.

**JOURNAL PROMPTS**
Add personal reflection questions that you answer each day. Whether it's "What am I grateful for?" or "What's my focus today?", daily journaling helps you stay mindful and intentional.

**TRACK YOUR PROGRESS**
See your daily score based on habit completion. View your 7-day history, track your streak, and celebrate your best days. The dashboard gives you a clear picture of your consistency.

**SET BIGGER GOALS**
Create long-term goals and link them to your daily habits. Track progress toward reading more books, running more miles, or any measurable objective that matters to you.

**SIMPLE & FOCUSED**
No complicated features or overwhelming options. DayGo focuses on what works: consistent daily action. Add your habits, check them off, and build momentum.

**PRIVACY FIRST**
