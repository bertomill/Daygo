# Stripe Integration Issues Found

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Webhook URL Mismatch
- **Issue**: Webhook is configured for `https://daygo.live/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **App URL**: `https://www.daygo.live/api/webhooks/stripe`
- **Problem**: Missing "www" subdomain causes webhook delivery failures
- **Fix**: Update webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard to match app URL exactly

### 2. Test/Production Environment Mismatch
- **Issue**: Using test keys with production URL
- **Current**: Test keys (`pk_test_...`, `sk_test_...`) with `https://www.daygo.live`
- **Problem**: Stripe test mode webhooks may not deliver to production URLs consistently
- **Fix**: Use live keys for production or test keys with localhost for development

### 3. Recent Activity Analysis
- **Customers**: 4 recent customers created but none have active subscriptions
- **Events**: Recent subscription events but customers show 0 subscriptions
- **Checkout**: Completed sessions but no resulting subscriptions
- **Issue**: Subscription creation is failing after checkout completion

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Action Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Webhook URL (Critical)
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard > Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Find the webhook for `https://daygo.live/api/webhooks/stripe`
3. Update URL to `https://www.daygo.live/api/webhooks/stripe`
4. Test webhook delivery using Stripe Dashboard

### Phase 2: Environment Configuration (High Priority)
Choose one of these approaches:

#### Option A: Switch to Live Mode (Recommended for Production)
1. Get live keys from Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `.env`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   ```
3. Create new webhook endpoint for live mode
4. Update webhook secret in `.env`

#### Option B: Keep Test Mode (Development)
1. Use with localhost development only
2. Use Stripe CLI for local webhook testing:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
   ```

### Phase 3: Subscription Flow Investigation
1. Test complete checkout flow
2. Monitor webhook logs for subscription events
3. Check Firestore for subscription document creation
4. Verify user subscription status updates

## ðŸ”§ Enhanced Logging Benefits

The enhanced webhook logging will now provide:
- Detailed request/response information
- Subscription metadata validation
- Processing time tracking
- Error stack traces
- Environment validation
